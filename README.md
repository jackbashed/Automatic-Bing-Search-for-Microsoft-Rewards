# Automatic-Bing-Search-for-Microsoft-Rewards

More indepth tutorial below. Otherwise if your lazy just read this. Install Opn. Install Node.js . 

This is a automatic bing search for Microsoft. Using this it will be able to search automatically for you within seconds.
This allows you to finish your microsoft rewards with the tap of a button.
This uses javascript, node.js, and opn.
Very simple to set up.

Ok for this to work you need to install a package called opn. https://www.npmjs.com/package/opn if you want to install it open your command prompt or terminal, and type $ npm install opn. If that doesnt work remove the "$" = npm install opn 

Next install node js. https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Node.Js-on-Windows.

Now, it should be as simple as typing, node BingGitHub.js
if that doesnt work you may need to move the file into your user. /users/(name)/BingGitHub.js
